## Call

In programming, "call" usually refers to invoking or executing a function or method. When you "call" a function, you are telling the program to execute the code within that function. For example, `functionName()` is a function call in many programming languages.

## Apply

"Apply" is a method or function available in some programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and others. It is used to call a function with a given `this` value, and an array or iterable of arguments. The `apply()` method sets `this` to the first argument passed to it, and then calls the function with the provided arguments. In JavaScript, it's commonly used with arrays when you want to spread the array elements as arguments to a function.

## Bind

"Bind" is a method available in many programming languages, especially in JavaScript. It creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. It essentially allows you to create a new function with a specified context for `this`, which can be particularly useful in event handling or when you want to preserve the value of `this` in certain contexts.
