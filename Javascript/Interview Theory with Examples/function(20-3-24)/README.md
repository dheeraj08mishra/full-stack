// Shortest JS Program

// When executed, this program:
// - Creates a Global Execution Context (GEC)
// - Creates the window object, which is a collection of functions and variables.
// - At the global level, 'this' refers to the window object.
// - Any variable or code outside a function is considered part of the global space.

// This file intentionally left blank.

This README.md snippet provides a brief explanation of the behavior of a blank JavaScript file. It highlights the creation of the Global Execution Context, the window object, and the concept of global space code.
