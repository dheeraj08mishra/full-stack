## Errors Related to let, const, and var Declarations

### Syntax Error: Redefinition of a Variable
Attempting to redeclare a variable using `let`, `const`, or `var` will result in a syntax error.

```javascript
// Syntax Error Example
let a = 10;
var a = 10; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared


Type Error: Assignment to a Constant Variable
Trying to reassign a value to a variable declared with const will lead to a type error.

// Type Error Example
const b = 100;
b = 1000; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.


Reference Error: Accessing a Variable Before Declaration
Accessing a variable before it has been declared results in a reference error.

// Reference Error Example
console.log(c); // ReferenceError: c is not defined
let c = 20;


 Additional Notes
Variables declared with let and const do not belong to the global scope but to the script or block scope, which prevents accessing them before declaration.
let variables are subject to the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until they are initialized.
Redeclaring a variable using let, const, or var within the same scope results in a syntax error.
const variables cannot be reassigned, attempting to do so will result in a type error.
