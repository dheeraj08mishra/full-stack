# React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. They enable functional components to manage state, lifecycle, and other React features. 

## useState()

`useState()` is a React Hook that provides state management capabilities to functional components. It takes an initial state as an argument and returns a stateful value and a function to update it. Whenever the state is updated, React re-renders the component.

## useEffect()

`useEffect()` is another Hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It can be used to perform data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It runs after every render, including the first render, and you can think of it as a combination of `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods in class components.

# React Fiber

React Fiber is the internal implementation of the reconciliation algorithm in React. Its purpose is to enable asynchronous rendering and update prioritization. It breaks down the rendering process into smaller chunks called fibers, allowing React to pause and resume work as needed, making the application more responsive.

## Virtual DOM

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. It is a JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the actual DOM elements. React uses the Virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI without directly manipulating the real DOM.

## Reconciliation Algorithm

React's reconciliation algorithm, implemented by React Fiber, is responsible for efficiently updating the DOM to reflect changes in the component state. It works by comparing the previous Virtual DOM with the new Virtual DOM and determining the minimum set of changes needed to update the actual DOM. This process is known as the diffing algorithm.

The [React Fiber Architecture](https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture) provides detailed insights into how React Fiber works internally and its benefits for building performant React applications.
