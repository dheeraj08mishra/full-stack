Display --> Block level, div <p>
            Inline level <span><button>

if we give display inline it will break in div like it will get stackup on each other

eg-> block element has height and width  but as soon as we give it display inline 
height and width will no longer work

padding means -> inside border
margin -> outer border


100 px height and width
10px border
10px margin 

total - 120 px


margin overlapping
if all properties are same then margin will get overlap 

or whoose margin is bigger will occupied space

width+padding+border = actual width of element
height+padding+border = actual height of element

box sizing property
if border box --> only height padding border  not margin
content box --> width and height only included
