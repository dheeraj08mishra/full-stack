Create an HTML page that demonstrates the use of the position property.

Inside the container <div>:

1. The page should display 4 boxes (divs with 'box' as a class).

2. Each with unique class 'absolute', 'relative', 'fixed', and 'static'.

3. Use CSS to set the associated position attribute respectively.

4. Give all boxes unique top, right, left, and bottom values as well.

Ex:

<div class="box absolute"></div>

should have the position set to 'absolute'.
