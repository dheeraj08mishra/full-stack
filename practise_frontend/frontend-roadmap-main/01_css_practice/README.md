if we apply width 
let say parent width is 100 px and we give 50 % to child then child width will be 50px

# don't apply direct width and heigth try to apply max width and max heigth

if we didn't give width to parent still child will follow the rule
but in case of height it is must to give value to parent if we want to apply rule to child

# for creating a circle height and width should be same first then give border radius property to 100%
# box sizing - border box updates the content height with content = total-2(padding+border)
# by default boxsizing is content box

# defer in html for js

# padStart and padEnd for applying */anyChar before or after string eg.. like we show last 4 char in aadhar card in masking
# 'EHHHHHHHHH'.substring(6,10).padStart(10,'*')--->'******HHHH'

# null undefined '' 0 -0 NaN are falsy
